# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED ðŸš¨

## The app is currently broken due to RLS policies

### Step 1: Fix the Database (DO THIS NOW)

1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy ALL contents from `emergency_fix_rls.sql`
4. Paste and run it
5. Wait for it to complete
6. Check the output - it should show simplified policies at the end

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After running the SQL:
1. Try creating a new canvas - it should work
2. Try opening an existing canvas - it should work
3. Multi-select and group creation should work

### What This Fix Does

- Completely removes ALL existing RLS policies
- Creates new, simple policies that just check user ownership
- No recursive checks, no complex logic
- Should eliminate the "infinite recursion detected" error

### If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still see errors after running the emergency fix:

1. Check if the SQL ran successfully (no errors in output)
2. Try refreshing your browser
3. Clear your browser cache
4. As a last resort, you can temporarily disable RLS:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE canvases DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE nodes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE edges DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

### Current App Status

- Basic functionality works (with RLS fixed)
- Multi-select works
- Regular groups work
- Nested canvas features are temporarily disabled

### Next Steps (After Fix)

Once the app is working:
1. Test all basic features
2. We can carefully re-enable nested canvases
3. Implement proper state management to avoid loops
